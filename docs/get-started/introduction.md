# Introduction to GraphAI

GraphAI is a minimalistic "AI framework" that aims to not be an AI framework at all. Instead, it provides a simple, flexible graph-based architecture that engineers can use to develop their own AI frameworks and projects.

## What is GraphAI?

GraphAI is a lightweight library built around the concept of a computational graph. It provides:

1. A **graph-based architecture** for connecting various components in a workflow
2. An **async-first design** to handle API calls efficiently
3. **Minimal abstractions** to avoid boxing developers into a specific AI implementation
4. **Flexible callback mechanisms** for streaming and communication between components

Unlike other AI libraries, GraphAI doesn't ship with predefined concepts of "LLMs", "Agents", or other high-level AI abstractions. Instead, it gives you the tools to build these concepts yourself, exactly how you want them.

## Why GraphAI?

Many existing AI frameworks impose their view of what AI applications should look like, creating a "local minimum" that constrains innovation. GraphAI takes a different approach:

- **Bring your own components**: Use any LLM provider, agent methodology, or telemetry system
- **Create your perfect workflow**: Build exactly the AI application architecture you need
- **Escape the box**: Don't be limited by someone else's conception of AI
- **Focus on flow, not frameworks**: Think about how data and processing should flow through your application

## Key Features

### Async-First

AI applications frequently rely on API calls that involve significant waiting time. GraphAI is built from the ground up to be async-first, allowing your Python code to efficiently handle these operations rather than wasting compute cycles while waiting for responses.

### Graph-Based Architecture

At its core, GraphAI provides a graph of connected nodes where:

- **Nodes** are processing units that perform specific tasks
- **Edges** connect nodes to define the flow of data
- **Routers** (special nodes) make decisions about the next execution path

This architecture makes complex workflows simple to understand and modify.

### Minimalist Design

GraphAI provides just what you need, nothing more:

- A `Graph` class for orchestrating execution
- `Node` and `Router` decorators for defining processing units
- `Callback` for streaming and communication
- `State` management for maintaining context

## When to Use GraphAI

Consider GraphAI when:

1. You need complete control over your AI application architecture
2. Existing frameworks feel too restrictive or opinionated
3. You want to combine components from different AI ecosystems
4. You prefer explicit, understandable code over magic abstractions
5. You're building something truly innovative that doesn't fit existing patterns
