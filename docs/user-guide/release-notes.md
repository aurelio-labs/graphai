See below for all notable changes to the GraphAI library.

## [0.0.10] - TBD

### Added
- Direct Starlette support for `GraphEvent` and `EventCallback` objects
- Parallel node execution for graphs with multiple outgoing edges from a single node
  - Automatic concurrent execution when a node has multiple successors
  - State merging from parallel branches
  - Configurable through standard `add_edge()` calls
- New `add_join()` method for explicit convergence of parallel branches
  - Synchronizes multiple parallel branches to a single destination node
  - Ensures convergence node executes only once with merged state
  - Prevents duplicate execution of downstream nodes
- New `add_parallel()` convenience method for creating parallel branches
  - Syntactic sugar for adding multiple edges from one source to multiple destinations

## [0.0.9] - 2025-09-05

### Added
- Enhanced `FunctionSchema.from_pydantic()` method with full Pydantic v2 support
  - Correctly extracts field types, descriptions, and default values from Pydantic models
  - Handles `Optional` types and complex type annotations
  - Properly identifies required vs optional fields using `PydanticUndefined`
- New `to_openai()` method on FunctionSchema for OpenAI API format support
  - Supports both `completions` and `responses` API endpoints
  - Export schemas for either nested or flat format structures
- New `EventCallback` class for object-based callback handling
  - Outputs structured `GraphEvent` objects instead of formatted strings
  - Provides `GraphEventType` enum for event type identification
  - Better structured data with `type`, `identifier`, `token`, and `params` fields
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing callback interface
- Comprehensive graph compilation validation
  - Stricter validation of node connections and dependencies
  - Better error messages for graph construction issues
  - Cycle detection with clear `GraphCompileError` reporting
- New `execute_many()` method for concurrent graph execution
  - Execute the graph on multiple inputs concurrently
  - Configurable concurrency level to control parallel execution
  - Preserves input order in results for predictable output

### Changed
- Graph compilation now validates execution order at compile time
- Graphs with cycles now raise `GraphCompileError` during compilation to ensure predictable execution order

### Deprecated
- `Callback` class is deprecated and will be removed in v0.1.0 - use `EventCallback` instead
- `special_token_format` and `token_format` parameters in `EventCallback` exist for backwards compatibility but are deprecated and will be removed in v0.1.0

### Fixed
- Added Python 3.10 compatibility for `StrEnum` with fallback implementation
- Fixed type annotation issues with `default_factory` in Pydantic field definitions
- Improved type extraction for complex Pydantic field types including `Union` and `Optional`

## [0.0.8] - 2025-08-16

### Added
- Graph constructor methods [`add_node`, `add_router`, `add_edge`, `set_callback`, `set_state`, `update_state`, `reset_state`, `set_start_node`, `set_end_node`, `compile`] can now be chained
- Moved `Callback` class to top-level import, you can now import it with `from graphai import Callback`
- Environment variable `GRAPHAI_LOG_LEVEL` for controlling log output level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

### Changed
- Dropped `networkx`, `matplotlib`, and `colorlog` dependencies (note if using `Graph.visualize` one of `networkx` or `matplotlib` must be installed)
- Updated documentation notebooks to use new callback pattern
- Updated old type annotations to use Python 3.10+ syntax, e.g., `List[str]` -> `list[str]` and `Optional[list]` -> `list | None`

## [0.0.7] - Removed

## [0.0.6] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- Explicit callback parameter in `execute()` method for better control over callback instances
- `NodeProtocol` type definition for improved type safety and IDE support
- Enhanced documentation examples demonstrating proper parallel execution patterns
- New `set_callback()` method for customizing default callback class

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Refactored callback handling to eliminate shared state between parallel executions
- Modified `execute()` method signature to accept optional `callback` parameter
- Removed internal `self.callback` attribute
- Updated all documentation notebooks to use new callback pattern
- Improved type hints throughout codebase using `Type[Callback]`

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed callback stream contamination when multiple graphs executed in parallel
- Resolved race conditions in multi-threaded environments
- Fixed inconsistent streaming behavior in concurrent scenarios
- Improved memory management and reduced callback-related memory leaks
- Better cleanup of callback resources after execution

### Security
- Enhanced thread-safety for parallel graph execution
- Eliminated shared state vulnerabilities in callback handling

### Migration Guide
For basic usage, no changes required - the API remains backwards compatible.
For custom callbacks, update from:
```python
# Before (v0.0.5)
cb = graph.get_callback()
graph.callback = cb
result = await graph.execute(input=data)
```
To:
```python
# After (v0.0.6)
cb = graph.get_callback()
result = await graph.execute(input=data, callback=cb)
```

## [0.0.5] - 2025-03-30

### Added
- New function schema functionality for generating standardized function schemas compatible with various LLM providers
- Built-in colored logger with support for different log levels and custom formatting
- Support for generating function schemas from Pydantic models

### Changed
- Removed dependency on semantic router library
- Improved type mapping for function parameters in schemas
- Enhanced documentation and code organization

### Fixed
- Various bug fixes and improvements

### Security
- No security-related changes in this release
